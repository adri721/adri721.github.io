title: Total Ergonomic Burden Assessment (TEBA)
---

### Abstract
This project developed a quantitative framework to assess ergonomic burden based on human posture and motion. A wearable motion capture system using inertial measurement units (IMUs) was designed to estimate joint kinematics in real time. Sensor data were filtered and fused using an Extended Kalman Filter and mapped to a virtual human model. Postural classifications were used to compute ergonomic burden scores, enabling early identification of high-risk tasks in industrial settings.

### Technical Contributions
- Designed a wearable IMU-based motion capture suit
- Implemented sensor fusion using an Extended Kalman Filter
- Mapped real-time motion data to a virtual mannequin in Unity
- Developed a posture-based ergonomic burden scoring protocol

### Methods
Wearable sensing, EKF, motion capture, human biomechanics

### Outcome
Demonstrated automated ergonomic assessment without reliance on optical tracking.
