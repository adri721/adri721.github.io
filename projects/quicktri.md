title: QuickTri: Non-contact Vitals Monitoring
---

### Abstract
QuickTri is a non-contact system for estimating vital signs using video-based photoplethysmography. The system extracts physiological signals from RGB video captured by a standard webcam, enabling estimation of heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation. Signal processing pipelines were developed to isolate skin pixels, extract plethysmographic signals, and compute vital parameters. The approach enables remote triaging without physical sensors or specialized hardware.

### Technical Contributions
- Developed video-based photoplethysmography pipeline using RGB signals
- Implemented signal extraction and peak detection for vitals estimation
- Designed a privacy-preserving, hardware-agnostic system
- Validated feasibility on consumer-grade cameras

### Methods
Computer vision, signal processing, remote PPG

### Outcome
Winning project at the MIT COVID-19 Hackathon.
