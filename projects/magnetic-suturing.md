# Magnetically Actuated Suturing Needles

[← Back to Projects](/projects)

### Abstract
This project investigates the feasibility of magnetically actuated suturing needles for subcutaneous suturing under image guidance. An electromagnetic actuation system was designed to control needle translation and rotation, with feedback obtained from vision and fluoroscopic imaging. Vision-based pose estimation was integrated with closed-loop control to achieve accurate needle manipulation. The system was validated through phantom experiments, demonstrating controlled needle trajectories suitable for suturing patterns.
