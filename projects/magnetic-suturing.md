title: Magnetically Actuated Suturing Needles
---

### Abstract
This project investigates the feasibility of magnetically actuated suturing needles for subcutaneous suturing under image guidance. An electromagnetic actuation system was designed to control needle translation and rotation, with feedback obtained from vision and fluoroscopic imaging. Vision-based pose estimation was integrated with closed-loop control to achieve accurate needle manipulation. The system was validated through phantom experiments, demonstrating controlled needle trajectories suitable for suturing patterns.

### Technical Contributions
- Designed and built an electromagnetic actuation workspace for magnetic needle control
- Developed vision-based needle pose estimation using probabilistic Hough transforms
- Implemented closed-loop control using feedback linearization
- Integrated camera and fluoroscope imaging as feedback modalities

### Methods
Computer vision, feedback linearization, electromagnetic actuation, image-guided control

### Outcome
Validated on agar and gelatin phantoms with successful closed-loop needle control.
