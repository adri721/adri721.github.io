# Concentric Tube Robots for Minimally Invasive Surgery

### Abstract
This project focused on the modeling, fabrication, and kinematic validation of concentric tube continuum robots for minimally invasive surgical applications. A two-tube robot was designed using additive manufacturing techniques, and inverse kinematics were derived using Euler–Bernoulli beam theory and energy minimization principles. The proposed modeling approach was experimentally validated using vision-based motion capture to assess kinematic accuracy.
