title: Concentric Tube Robots for Minimally Invasive Surgery
---

### Abstract
This project focused on the modeling and control of concentric tube robots for minimally invasive surgical applications. A two-tube continuum robot was designed using additive manufacturing techniques to enable patient-specific customization. Inverse kinematics were derived using Euler–Bernoulli beam theory and energy minimization principles. Experimental validation was performed using stereo vision-based motion capture to assess the accuracy of the kinematic model.

### Technical Contributions

- Derived inverse kinematics using beam mechanics and energy minimization
- Implemented model-based control for a two-tube system
- Validated kinematics using stereo vision motion capture

### Methods
Continuum robotics, beam theory, inverse kinematics, stereo vision

### Outcome
Demonstrated accurate kinematic modeling and experimental validation of continuum robot behavior.
